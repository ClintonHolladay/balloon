Temperature (inside and outside box) - [https://www.adafruit.com/product/1782 accurate down to -50] 
                                       [https://www.adafruit.com/product/372 good down to -55C (-67F)] 

UV (https://www.adafruit.com/product/3964) 
   -- how to keep sensor warm enough to work but still exposed to the UV light? 
   Maybe enclosed except for tiny hole for sensor on board...
